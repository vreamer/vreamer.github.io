<p>I started off using Android Emulators from Android Virtual Device (AVD) Manager. However, with the extra memory and CPU consumption from the emulator, my development speed really took a hit. Especially when I try to utilize the hot reload feature from Flutter, it takes several seconds to load the changes and heat up my computer at the same time.</p>
<p>Hence, I was looking for a slimmer and faster emulator alternative. After some <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-android-emulators-for-pc-655308/">research</a>, I narrowed down to BlueStacks. Now the hot reload is almost instant and my computer stays cool while doing it.</p>
<p>But compared to using Android Emulators from AVD. There are some extra configurations to help Flutter detect Bluestacks as a runnable device. These configurations should be similar if you choose other Android Emulators. In this blog, we will use Bluestacks as an example to make Flutter detect your emulators.</p>
<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Flutter
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/r7yVCG3.png?2" alt="Flutter Version"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BlueStacks 4</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/fWzT5La.png?1" alt="BlueStacks Version 4"></p>
<h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>
<p>The third step is optional. You can skip if your emulator works fine after the first two steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Install BlueStacks</li>
</ol>
<p>Install BlueStacks from <a href="https://www.bluestacks.com/">here</a>. For Mac users, if you run into security setting issues. You can refer to this <a href="https://support.bluestacks.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000736632-How-can-I-Install-and-launch-BlueStacks-on-Mac-OS-">blog</a>.</p>
<p>After the BlueStacks Emulator is up and running, we can run <code>flutter devices</code> At this moment, Flutter cannot find the BlueStacks Emulator. That&rsquo;s because we haven&rsquo;t turn on the debug mode.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WT0gNWa.png" alt="No Devices"></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Enable Android Debug Bridge (ADB)</li>
</ol>
<p>Go to <code>BlueStacks &gt;&gt; Preferences &gt;&gt; Preferences</code></p>
<p>Check the <code>Enable Android Debug Bridge (ADB)</code> option</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vPKEx3d.png?1" alt="Enable ADB"></p>
<p>Try to run <code>flutter devices</code> again. At this point, you should see BlueStacks Emulator listed under flutter devices.

<p>If the BlueStacks Emulator is not present, proceed to the next step.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>(Optional) Connect with ADB</li>
</ol>
<p>The BlueStacks Emulator is running on port 5555. Connect manually with adb</p>
<pre><code>adb connect localhost:5555
</code></pre><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/jHM6NFI.png" alt="Connect manually"></p>
<p>Lastly, run <code>flutter devices</code> again to confirm the BlueStacks Emulator is detected.</p>
<p>Now <code>flutter run</code> will install the apk on the BlueStacks Emulator.</p>
