      <p><strong>Glat</strong>: Goal of Life = Action + Time -&gt; Knowledge</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong> is something you want but don&rsquo;t have yet
In order to achieve your <strong>goal</strong>, or in other words, to obtain the desired things, one needs to take <strong>actions</strong> to change the current situation. However, it&rsquo;s easier said than done. It&rsquo;s often difficult to map out the exact route from the current situation to the desired goal. Therefore, when we experiment with different actions, we obtain <strong>knowledge</strong> that is unique to us. That knowledge is also valuable to our <strong>friends</strong>.</p>
<p>For people who use <strong>Glat</strong> by itself, here are four ways to help increase efficiency</p>
<ul>
<li>Breakdown</li>
<li>Prioritize</li>
<li>Schedule</li>
<li>Dangling</li>
</ul>
<p>To make Glat more powerful, we can collaborate with friends in following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organize relationships</li>
<li>Share goals/actions/knowledge with friends</li>
<li>Collaboration on same goal</li>
</ul>
